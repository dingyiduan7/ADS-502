#' # Class Imbalance Problem
#'
#' Classifiers have a hard time to learn from data where we have much more observations for one class (called the majority class). This is called the class imbalance problem.
#'
#' Here is a very good [article about the problem and solutions.](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/learning-from-imbalanced-classes.html)
#'
#' We want to decide if an animal is an reptile. First we change the class variable
#' to make it into a binary reptile/no reptile classification problem.
#' __Note:__ We use here the training data for testing. You should use a
#' separate testing data set!
data(Zoo)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

Zoo_reptile <- Zoo
Zoo_reptile$type <- factor(Zoo$type == "reptile",
  levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels =c("nonreptile", "reptile"))
#' Do not forget to make the class variable a factor (a nominal variable)
#' or you will get a regression tree instead of a classification tree.

summary(Zoo_reptile)

#' See if we have a class imbalance problem.
barplot(table(Zoo_reptile$type), xlab = "Reptile", ylab="Count")
#' the new class variable is clearly not balanced. This is a problem
#' for building a tree!
#'
#' ## Option 1: Use the Data As Is and Hope For The Best

fit <- train(type ~ ., data=Zoo_reptile, method = "rpart",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
fit
rpart.plot(fit$finalModel, extra = 2, under = TRUE, varlen = 0, faclen = 0)
#' the tree predicts everything as non-reptile. Have a look at the error on
#' the training set.

confusionMatrix(data = predict(fit, Zoo_reptile),
  ref = Zoo_reptile$type, positive = "reptile")
#' The accuracy is exactly the same as the no-information rate
#' and kappa is zero. Sensitivity is also zero, meaning that we do not identify
#' any positive (reptile). If the cost of missing a positive is much
#' larger than the cost associated with misclassifying a negative, then accuracy
#' is not a good measure!
#' By dealing with imbalance, we are __not__ concerned
#' with accuracy, but we want to increase the
#' sensitivity, i.e., the chance to identify positive examples.
#'
#' __Note:__ The positive class value (the one that
#' you want to detect) is set manually to reptile.
#' Otherwise sensitivity/specificity will not be correctly calculated.
#'
#' ## Option 2: Balance Data With Resampling
#'
#' We use stradified sampling with replacement (to oversample the
#' minority/positive class).
#' You could also use SMOTE (in package __DMwR__) or other sampling strategies (e.g., from package __unbalanced__). We
#' use only 50+50 observations here since our dataset has only 101 observations total.
library(sampling)
id <- strata(Zoo_reptile, stratanames="type", size=c(50,50), method="srswr")
Zoo_reptile_balanced <- Zoo_reptile[id$ID_unit, ]
table(Zoo_reptile_balanced$type)

fit <- train(type ~ ., data = Zoo_reptile_balanced, method = "rpart",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"),
  control = rpart.control(minsplit = 5))
fit
rpart.plot(fit$finalModel, extra = 2, under = TRUE,  varlen = 0, faclen = 0)

#' Check on balanced training data.
confusionMatrix(data = predict(fit, Zoo_reptile_balanced),
  ref = Zoo_reptile_balanced$type, positive = "reptile")
#' We see that sensitivity is now 1 which means that we are able to identify all
#' reptiles (pos. examples).
#'
#'
#' However, real data that we will make predictions for will not be balanced.
#' Check on original data with original class distribution.

confusionMatrix(data = predict(fit, Zoo_reptile),
  ref = Zoo_reptile$type, positive = "reptile")

#' __Note__ that the accuracy is below the no information rate! However,
#' you see that this model is able to find all reptiles (sensitivity of 1),
#' but it also misclassifies
#' many non-reptiles as reptiles. The tradeoff can be controlled using the sample
#' proportions.
#'

#' ## Option 3: Build A Larger Tree and use Predicted Probabilities
#'
#' Increase complexity and require less data for splitting a node.
#' Here I also use AUC (area under the ROC) as the tuning metric.
#' You need to specify the two class
#' summary function. Note that the tree still trying to improve accuracy on the
#' data and not AUC! I also enable class probabilities since I want to predict
#' probabilities later.

fit <- train(type ~ ., data=Zoo_reptile, method = "rpart",
  tuneLength=20,
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
    classProbs = TRUE,                 ## necessary for predict with type="prob"
    summaryFunction=twoClassSummary),  ## necessary for ROC
  metric = "ROC",
  control = rpart.control(minsplit = 5))
fit

rpart.plot(fit$finalModel, extra = 2, under = TRUE, varlen = 0, faclen = 0)

confusionMatrix(data = predict(fit, Zoo_reptile),
  ref = Zoo_reptile$type, positive = "reptile")
#' __Note:__ Accuracy is high, but it is close to the no-information rate!
#'
#' ### Create A Biased Classifier
#'
#' We can create a classifier which will detect more reptiles
#' at the expense of misclassifying non-reptiles. This is equivalent
#' to increasing the cost of misclassifying a reptile as a non-reptile.
#' The usual rule is to predict in each node
#' the majority class from the test data in the node.
#' For a binary classification problem that means a probability of >50%.
#' In the following, we reduce this threshold to 25% or more.
#' This means that if the new observation ends up in a leaf node with 25% or
#'  more reptiles from training then the observation
#'  will be classified as a reptile.
#'
#'  __Note__ that you should use an unseen test set
#'  for `predict()` here! I did not do that since the data set is too small!
prob <- predict(fit, Zoo_reptile, type = "prob")
tail(prob)
pred <- as.factor(ifelse(prob[,"reptile"]>=.25, "reptile", "nonreptile"))


confusionMatrix(data = pred,
  ref = Zoo_reptile$type, positive = "reptile")
#' __Note__ that accuracy goes down and is below the no information rate.
#' However, both measures are based on the idea that all errors have the same
#' cost. What is important is that we are now able to find all almost all
#' reptiles (sensitivity is .8) while before we only found 2 out of 5
#' (sensitivity of .4)
#'

#' ### Plot the ROC Curve
#' Since we have a binary classification problem and a classifier that predicts
#' a probability for an observation to be a reptile, we can also use a
#' [receiver operating characteristic (ROC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)
#' curve. For the ROC curve all different cutoff thresholds for the probability
#' are used and then connected with a line.
library("pROC")
r <- roc(Zoo_reptile$type == "reptile", prob[,"reptile"])
r

plot(r)
#' This also reports the area under the curve.
#'

#' ## Option 4: Use a Cost-Sensitive Classifier
#'
#' The implementation of CART in `rpart` can use a cost matrix for making splitting
#' decisions (as parameter `loss`). The matrix has the form
#'
#'  TP FP
#'  FN TN
#'
#' TP and TN have to be 0. We make FN very expensive (100).

cost <- matrix(c(
  0,  1,
  100,0
), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2)
cost


fit <- train(type ~ ., data=Zoo_reptile, method = "rpart",
  parms = list(loss = cost),
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
#' The warning "There were missing values in resampled performance measures"
#' means that some folds did not contain any reptiles (because of the class imbalance)
#' and thus the performance measures could not be calculates.

fit

rpart.plot(fit$finalModel, extra = 2, under = TRUE, varlen = 0, faclen = 0)

confusionMatrix(data = predict(fit, Zoo_reptile),
  ref = Zoo_reptile$type, positive = "reptile")
#' The high cost for false negatives results in a classifier that does not miss any reptile.
#'
#' __Note:__ Using a cost-sensitive classifier is often the best option. Unfortunately, the most classification algorithms (or their implementation) do not have the ability to consider misclassification cost.
